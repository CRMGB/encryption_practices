# encryption_practices

## Encryption and decryption practices using python.

### There is a method called encrypt_file which gets a file locally,
### and encripts such file using a Fernet key generated on the fly.

### On the other side, there is a method "decrypt_file" which gets the same fernet Key and will decrypt it.
### Tested using Unittests.

### I will add AWS S3 in the future.
